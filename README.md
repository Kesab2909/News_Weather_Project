# News & Weather App

A responsive web application that provides users with real-time news updates and current weather conditions for a specified city. This project integrates the [GNews API](https://gnews.io/) for news and the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) for weather data. It uses a CORS proxy (such as AllOrigins or CORS Anywhere) to bypass cross-origin restrictions when deployed on GitHub Pages.
